code is data: its just binary stored somewhereits when your machine interprets these bits as instructions and executes them that it becomes code for a brief moment in time

Code is a subclass of data, with the extra property of having a direct operational semantics.

they are both data representing the state/functionality of some system but one‚Äôs ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is represented with DAGs and the other‚Äôs is stacked in a database without a clear causal structure track due to volume and frequency of change

Avoiding the ontological question: data usually lives longer than code, and that causes many subtle problems.

Very vaguely:Code is a set of symbols that changes the state of the machine.  Data is what the machine state acts on.

Data is whatever can be eaten by code.  Code is a special case of data that gets eaten by chips and LISP.

Code has no meaning except given to it by an interpreter.Code is the interpreter for its data.A C compiler interprets C source code.A CPU interprets machine code.The universe interprets the CPU's matter.Data vs. code is relative to an abstraction level.
