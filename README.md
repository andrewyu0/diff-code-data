## Approach
tweeturls.py parses content from urls.txt (manually picked top 35 as a start and added to urls.txt)

## Code as Instructions, Data as Observations
- "Code is instructions, data is observations" - Omar Javed
- "Code does something. Data gets things done to it. Code = machine. Data = materials" - Juan
- "Code is a set of symbols that changes the state of the machine. Data is what the machine state acts on" - Typing Loudly ⌨️
- "Code is data that describes what the computer should do" - Liron Shapira

## Code and Data as Interchangeable
- "In lisp… nothing ;)" - the Rich
- "Code is a subclass of data, with the extra property of having a direct operational semantics" - JM Jezequel
- "None if you use lisp, code is data and data is code, and all of it is a sexpr 😊" - Michael Malyuk
- "Data is whatever can be eaten by code. Code is a special case of data that gets eaten by chips and LISP" - Eliezer Yudkowsky ⏹️

## Code as Active, Data as Passive
- "Code is data that acts. Data is code at rest" - rohit
- "Code is data in motion" - Nikhil
- "Data flows according to code" - jelko🐍 ⭕️

## Code and Data in the Context of Von Neumann Architecture
- "*von neumann enters the chat*" - Jacob Eiting — iap/acc
- "In a Von Neumann architecture, none !" - vlangogh

## Other Unique Perspectives
- "One can be version-controlled and the other shouldn't be" - Bryan
- "Code has bugs and Data has discrepancies. 😂" - Newtonian
- "The execute permission bit" - Dylan Dean
- "Data is bouba, code is kiki" - frye
- "That’s like asking what is the difference between a map and the terrain it depicts" - Project Up
- "Code is a thing that acts like code, data is a thing that acts like data. Hope that clears it up ❤️" - double *jeremy
- "They are both data representing the state/functionality of some system but one’s “history” is represented with DAGs and the other’s is stacked in a database without a clear causal structure track due to volume and frequency of change" - 🐜onio
- "Avoiding the ontological question: data usually lives longer than code, and that causes many subtle problems" - Rafa Darder
- "It's code if it is being passed into an interpreter" - Kinrany
